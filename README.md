# Algorithm Practice

This repository contains my solutions and notes for:

- Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)
- Project Euler problems
- LeetCode problems
- Math and number theory exercises

The purpose of this repository is practice and learning.
Solutions may include brute-force attempts, optimized versions,
and notes explaining the thought process.
